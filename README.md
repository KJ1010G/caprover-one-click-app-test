Add a one-click app in the CapRover. This app just takes the link to a public GitHub repo and a port number. It spins up a docker container that serves an HTML file with the content saying how many files exist in the root directory of the repository. This docker container will expose itâ€™s port on that port specified along with the GitHub repo name.
